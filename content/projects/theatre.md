## Theatre I've been involved in

* Sunshine on Leith; May 2023; Bridewell Theatre; LX op for the second week: not quite to my taste, but well done. I liked the way the chorus was lit in _Letter from America_.
* Hunchback of Notre Dame; April 2023; London Oratory Theatre; followspot op: a really excellent production. First show appearing as myself. The bells!

## Theatre I've watched

* The Dead City; April 2023; London Coliseum: weird and surprising, but I enjoyed it. Some good lighting to contrast the inside with the dead city outside.
* Witness for the Prosecution; March 2023; London Guildhall
* The Effect; March 2023; Bridewell Theatre
* Akhnaten; March 2023; London Coliseum: impressive, but I struggled to discern a narrative or empathise with any of the characters
* The Rhinegold; March 2023; London Coliseum: arguably the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Wotan as mob boss. A wonderful final scene as the gods flee to the bunker of Valhalla, where they slam down the shutters to escape the voices of the Rhinemaidens.
* Carmen; February 2023; London Coliseum
