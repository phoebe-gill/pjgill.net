Hi, I'm Phoebe Gill. I'm currently standing as the Green Party candidate for Bethnal Green and Stepney.

I work for [Policy Expert](https://www.policyexpert.co.uk/) as a software engineer.

I am rather fond of the theatre, particularly opera - both as audience and back stage. I enjoy board/role-playing/video games, and am active in the Green Party.

My pronouns are she/her. I'm queer, trans, bi, and poly.
