I'm Phoebe Gill, a software engineer working for [Policy Expert](https://www.policyexpert.co.uk/).

I am rather fond of the theatre, particularly opera - both as audience and back stage. I enjoy board/role-playing/video games, and am active in the Green Party.

My preferred pronouns are she/her. They/them is also acceptable.

I maintain a [public salary history]({{< ref "page/salary_history.md" >}}).
