I'm Benjamin Gill,[^1] a software engineer working for [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) to make it easier to develop secure software.

[^1]: _not_ 'Ben'

I am rather fond of the theatre, particularly opera - both as audience and back stage. I enjoy board/role-playing/video games, and am active in the Green Party.

My preferred pronouns are they/them.[^2]

[^2]: the use of he/him is deprecated and will be removed in a future update; she/her is currently in alpha.

I maintain a [public salary history]({{< ref "page/salary_history.md" >}}).
