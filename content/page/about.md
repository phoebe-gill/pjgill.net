Hi, I'm Phoebe Gill. I work for [Policy Expert](https://www.policyexpert.co.uk/) as a software engineer. I recently stood for the Green Party in [Bethnal Green and Stepney]({{< ref "post/bethnal-green-and-stepney.md" >}}).

I am rather fond of the theatre, particularly opera - both as audience and back stage. I enjoy board/role-playing/video games, and am active in the Green Party.

My preferred pronouns are she/her. I'm queer, trans, bi, and poly.
